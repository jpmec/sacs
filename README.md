SACS

The Good
========

Simple API for C Structures

The SACS library allows for easier serialization of C structures.  
The goal of the SACS library is to allow a simple way to read/write C structures from/to strings.
The library parses and prints text that is formatted like a C structure initializer.
Any valid C code text that can be compiled can be read by SACS at run-time.
 
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_%28C_programming_language%29#Struct_initialization

SACS also has some 'enhancements' built in, such as reading boolean and binary values. 
 
The SACS library:

*   uses an event-driven parser, similar to SAX: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_API_for_XML
*   uses only the C standard library.  No other dependencies are needed.
*   does not malloc() any memory.  The library user must allocate all necessary memory in advance.
*   does not create any DOM object.  The data is written/read straight from the native C structure.

The SACS library is free! (See the License below)


Data types
----------
The data types supported by SACS can be found in the sacs.h file.  
SACS supports the C standard datatypes and the data types defined in the <stdint.h> file.
SACS allows structures to be nested.

Bitfields are not (yet?) supported by SACS.  An attempt has been made to support them, but it is not robust nor dependable.
The C standard does not define the order in which bitfields are stored,
therefore bitfields should not be used in structures intended on being serialized.
If you need to store 1-bit values, it is recommended that you use an unsigned value in the structure,
and access the individual bits using conventional C methods.


The Parsers
----------
A SACS parser will parse null-terminated strings of data.  
It will attempt to convert the string data into a representation needed by the C structure.  
A SACS parser should support any legal C syntax for initializing a structure.


The Emitters
------------
SACS can convert C structures into null-terminated strings.  The default SACS behavior is to emit valid C structure syntax.

SACS can also emit other formats, such as JSON, XML and YAML.

**All valid C structures can be emitted as valid JSON, XML and YAML.**

**Not all valid JSON, XML and YAML can be parsed as a valid C structure.**




The Bad
=======
It doesn't workâ€¦ yet.  Parts of the functionality are in place, along with the general framework for generating.

> **If you are expecting to download this library and it "just work" you will be very dissapointed.**



The Ugly
=======
The SACS framework is built using the C preprocessor.  
Therefore, any problem with formatting when writing C code that uses SACS causes weird, hard to debug compiler messages.
This problem may or may not improve in the future.  The code is freely available for examination.



The FAQs
========


**SACS doesn't work with Microsoft Visual C++?**
Microsoft Visual C++ does not support C99 features such as named designators.
Also, Microsoft Visual C++ does not compile C99 code.  Therefore, SACS probably won't ever work with MSVC++.  Sorry.  The source code is available if you want to port it yourself.

The Extras
==========
I hope you find the SACS library to be useful.  If you use it in a project, please send me a link, I'd love to know how it is being used in the wild.  Also, if you find a bug or make a great improvement, then make a Pull Request and I'll try to integrate the fix or feature.  Thanks!
